**Lectures:** The lectures will involve both slides and session notes on whiteboard. The lectures will predominantly be delivered in person. However, due to travel engagements, some of the lectures will be prerecorded and uploaded on Blackboard. Attending the synchronous lectures will be very important for the students to develop the concepts and skills, and also to be able to perform well in the exams, homeworks, and quizzes. 

**Homeworks:** At least five homework assignments will be assigned via throughout the semester. Assignments will be due via Blackboard. All assignment submissions must be in PDF format. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The protocol for file name is -.pdf, e.g., Debroy-HW4.pdf. </mark>Submissions in any other format and submitted via any platform other than Blackboard will not be graded. It is the students’ responsibility to keep track of the due dates. Submission after due date will not be allowed. 

***Quizzes:*** There will also be around 10 unannounced in-class pop quizzes during lecture hours (either before or after the lecture) containing multiple choice questions. There will be no retake of the quizzes. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Each quiz is 3%</mark>


**Exams:** There will be one mid-term (tentatively on the first/second week of November) and one final exam. For those having verified reasons to be absent during the mid-term, makeup exams may be arranged on an individual basis. Please contact me at least 1 week prior to the scheduled exam date, as it will not be possible to schedule a makeup “after the fact”. There will be no makeup for the final exam.
