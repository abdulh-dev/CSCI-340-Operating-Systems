#### OS Requirememnts
- There are requirements coming from what users want: 
	- Users want their time on the computer to be spent efficiently. • Users want their data to be secure. 
	- Users want using the computer to be as convenient and easy as possible. 
	- Users may want to be able to share data and applications selectively with other users. 
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">These are mandatory</mark>

- A computer, on some level, exists to produce value, directly or indirectly, for its owner. The more productive it is, the more value is created for the owner. This leads to additional requirements: 
	- The computer resources should be utilized as efficiently as possible, maximizing the amount of work it performs per unit time. 
	- The computer resources should be protected from all possible intentional and unintentional abuses. 
	- It should be possible to allocate resources as needed among various users.
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">These are added on to the foundation</mark>

- Preceding considerations lead to these additional tasks that operating systems must perform: 
	- An operating system should manage the resources of a computer system in such as way as to allow <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reliable sharing of data and applications</mark>. 
	- An operating system should provide <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">security and protection of all hardware and software</mark> on the computer system. 
	- An operating system should provide robust <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">error handling and recovery</mark>. 
	- An operating system should allocate resources fairly to users while trying to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maximize overall throughput, minimize response time</mark> to as many users as possible, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maximize the utilization of all hardware resources</mark> in the system.

#### OS services 
- Program execution - loading and executing programs; providing synchronization, communication, and security 
- I/O operations - providing all I/O services to users and applications 
- File systems - creating and maintaining file systems and means of manipulating them 
- Communication - providing mechanisms that allow programs to communicate with each other 
- Error detection and recovery - detecting and handling error conditions • Protection and security - preventing unauthorized or improper access to all resources, and protecting users from each other's attempts to invade privacy or corrupt data. 
- Accounting - monitoring and recording various performance and utilization metrics, for both users and the system.

#### Memory Technology
- Random Access: 
	- “Random” is good: access time is the same for all locations  
	- DRAM: Dynamic Random Access Memory • High density, low power, cheap, slow • Dynamic: need to be “refreshed” regularly 
	- SRAM: Static Random Access Memory • Low density, high power, expensive, fast • Static: content will last “forever”(until lose power) 
	- “Non-so-random” Access Technology: • Access time varies from location to location and from time to time • Examples: Disk, CDROM 
	- Sequential Access Technology: access time linear in location (e.g.,Tape)
